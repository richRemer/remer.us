The terms of our arrangement are ill-defined and fluid.  I don't know what value
you'll find here, or what you could possibly offer me as consideration for my
services, but suffice it to say you should have no expectations.  Or expect
the unexpected.  Maybe I'll drop some funny malware on your laptop that turns
all your photos into LOLcats.  Who knows?  If you are here, you are willingly
subjecting yourself to what I throw at you.
