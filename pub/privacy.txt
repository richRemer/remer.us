You are on the world wide web.  You have no privacy.  You should have no
expectation of privacy.  I have no intention of taking advantage of you or your
data or monetizing your presence in any way, but who knows?  The future is crazy
and maybe I'll pimp that shit for all its worth.  Don't share nothing if you
don't want nothing shared.  Common sense or are you a dumb ass?
